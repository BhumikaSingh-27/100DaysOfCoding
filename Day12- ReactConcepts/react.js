// React
// is a javascript library to build User Interface. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
//- Declarative
//-component based
//- Learn once, write anywhere

// Every thing in react is due to state change. React doen't manipulate all the DOM, rather it creates a virtual copyofDOm, and compares it with actual DOM.
//Wherever it finds the change, it directly manipulates the DOM, without refreshing the whole page.

//useState - is a function that returns array of state variable and setter function.
//when the state variable changes then the view changes.
//view is what the App() function returns.
// export default function App() {
//     return (
//       <div>
//         <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
//         <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
//       </div>
//     );
//   }
