//DAY 5
// difference between undefined and not defined
//JS loosely/ weakly coupled language, we don't have to specifically define the type of variable.
//undefined is the label/placeholder which is assigned before the execution of code.
//not defined variables are the ones which are not declared or has not be given memory space.
// console.log(a) //undefined
// var a = "bhumika"

// console.log(a) //bhumika
// console.log(b) //error: b is not defined!
